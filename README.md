# Let's Play Hanabi!

This repo contains the following algorithms to play Hanabi:

- Rainbow
- Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay (need improvement)
- Bayesian Action Decoder (TODO: reorganize jupyter notebook)

In the future, all the implementations should go to [https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl) and the patch of Hanabi.jl in `src/hanabi_environment.jl` should go to [https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl).
